# ALX Backend Storage

## Project Overview
This project focuses on advanced database management techniques and backend storage solutions, covering SQL queries, indexing, optimization, and database constraints. It demonstrates the use of stored procedures, triggers, views, and indexing to enhance database performance and maintain data integrity.

## Requirements
- MySQL 5.7
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- SQL scripts for database management tasks

## Concepts Covered
1. **Indexing**: 
   - Creating indices to optimize query performance. 
   - Example: Indexing the first letter of a name and the score.
  
2. **Stored Procedures**: 
   - Automating database operations using stored procedures.
   - Example: Procedures to calculate weighted average scores for users.
  
3. **Views**: 
   - Using views to simplify data retrieval.
   - Example: Creating a view to list students needing a meeting based on their scores and last meeting date.
  
4. **Triggers**: 
   - Enforcing database rules using triggers.
   - Example: Auto-updating average scores when data is modified.

## Key Tasks
- Creating tables with constraints and relationships (foreign keys, etc.).
- Writing optimized SQL queries using joins and aggregate functions.
- Creating indices for performance optimization.
- Implementing stored procedures for specific operations.
- Using views and triggers for complex data manipulations.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the provided SQL dump files.
3. Run the SQL scripts to execute the tasks.

## How to Run
- Use MySQL CLI or any MySQL-compatible client.
- Import the `.sql` files to set up the database:
  ```bash
  mysql -uroot -p < names.sql
  mysql -uroot -p < 8-index_my_names.sql
